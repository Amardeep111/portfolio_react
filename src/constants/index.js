export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a passionate front-end developer with a strong interest in building responsive and visually appealing web applications. Currently learning and working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive, real-world projects.

Alongside front-end development, I have a solid foundation in C++, which has sharpened my problem-solving skills. I'm constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to grow as a developer, with the goal of creating impactful digital experiences and building a successful career in tech.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a dedicated and curious front-end developer with a passion for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I'm currently diving deep into technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS, while also strengthening my programming skills with C++.

My journey into web development started with a simple curiosity about how websites work—and that curiosity has grown into a strong commitment to learning and improving every day. While I don't have professional experience yet, I've been actively working on personal projects and continuously exploring new tools and frameworks.

I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy solving problems, and am always excited to take on new challenges. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Lovely Professional University, I'm eager to kickstart my career and contribute to real-world solutions in the tech industry.

Outside of coding, I love learning about new technologies, staying motivated, and preparing myself to take on opportunities in the corporate world.`;
